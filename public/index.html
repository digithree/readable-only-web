    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Readable filter for the web. Put distance between your hardware and trackers.</p>
    <blockquote><i>
      Row, row, row your browser
      <br>Gently up the stream.
      <br>Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily,
      <br>Now your page is clean.</i>

    <p>This service applies Mozillas "Readability" standalone code (along with other processors) to attempt to extract article text from any give web resource.</p>
    <p>Uses a virtual DOM so cannot process any fancy Javascript (a good thing) so this might make rendering certain websites problematic.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Will show images, which might have tracking built in. Optional removal (with click to reveal) coming in future version.</p></li>
      <li><p>All links will also route through this service, giving you seemless usage. However links may have referral codes, removal in future version.</p></li>
      <li><p>Script injection is still possible, full cleaner coming in future version. Should be more or less okay for now.</p></li>

    <p>Written by Simon Kenny to prove a point... I mean proof of concept! You can get a lot out of just text. Enjoy the simple life yo.</p>
