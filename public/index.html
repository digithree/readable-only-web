    <h2>Getting Started [ROW]</h2>
    <p>Readable filter for the web. Put distance between your hardware and trackers.</p>
    <h3>ROW is the Readable Only Web</h3>
    <blockquote><i>Row, row, row your browser
    <br>Gently up the stream.
    <br>Merrily, merrily merrily, merrily,
    <br>Now your page is clean.</i></blockquote>
    <p>This service applies Mozillas "Readability" standalone code (along with other processors) to attempt to extract article text from any give web resource. Will only work for standard articles without access-walls in the current version.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Add your website in the query parameter "q" for our URL and "url" endpoint, e.g. http://row.fr.openode.io/url?q=http://website.com/some-article</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Will show images, which might have tracking built in. Optional removal (with click to reveal) coming in future version.</p></li>
      <li><p>All links will also route through this service, giving you seemless usage. However links may have referral codes, removal in future version.</p></li>
      <li><p>Script injection is still possible, full cleaner coming in future version. Should be more or less okay for now.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
    <p>Written by Simon Kenny to prove a point... I mean proof of concept! You can get a lot out of just text. Enjoy the simple life yo.</p>
