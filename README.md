# Readable Only Web

Readable filter for the web. Put distance between your hardware and trackers.

## Early version notice

In super early version here, will create a better README if this project has legs.

## Installation

I used to use Heroku but now I can't recommend anything really.

But the whole idea is to run it _not on your own machine_, rather on a third party webserver out there in cloud-cuckoo-land, ideally with more than person using it to really confuse the trackers.
